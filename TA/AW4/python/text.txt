YOU NEVER KNOW HOW STRONG YOU ARE UNTIL BEING STRONG IS THE ONLY CHOICE YOU HAVE IN LIFE.
IN THE END WE ONLY REGRET THE CHANCES WE DIDN’T TAKE.
ENJOY LIFE TODAY, YESTERDAY IS GONE AND TOMORROW MAY NEVER CAME UP.
SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO LET THINGS GO.
SOME PEOPLE ARE SO POOR, ALL THEY HAVE IS MONEY.
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT WAITING FOR THE STORM TO PASS, IT’S ABOUT LEARNING TO DANCE IN THE RAIN.
LIFE IS A ONE TIME OFFER, USE IT WELL.
LIVE YOUR LIFE AND FORGET YOUR AGE.
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT FINDING YOURSELF. LIFE IS ABOUT CREATING YOURSELF.
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO WAIT.
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR.
LIFE IS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE LAUGHING.
FORGET THE DAY’S TROUBLES. REMEMBER THE DAYS BLESSINGS.
LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST, BECAUSE IT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE.
LIFE DOESN’T GET EASIER, YOU JUST GET STRONGER.
YOU LIVE THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE.
LOVE THE LIFE YOU LIVE, LIVE THE LIFE YOU LOVE.
LIFE IS TO BE ENJOYED, NOT JUST ENDURED.
NEVER GET SO BUSY MAKING A LIVING THAT YOU FORGET TO MAKE A LIFE.
STOP EXISTING AND START LIVING.
DREAM AS IF YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER. LIVE AS IF YOU WILL DIE TODAY.
