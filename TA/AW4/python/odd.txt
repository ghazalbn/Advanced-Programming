IN THE END WE ONLY REGRET THE CHANCES WE DIDN’T TAKE.
SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO LET THINGS GO.
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT WAITING FOR THE STORM TO PASS, IT’S ABOUT LEARNING TO DANCE IN THE RAIN.
LIVE YOUR LIFE AND FORGET YOUR AGE.
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO WAIT.
LIFE IS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE LAUGHING.
LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST, BECAUSE IT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE.
YOU LIVE THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE.
LIFE IS TO BE ENJOYED, NOT JUST ENDURED.
STOP EXISTING AND START LIVING.
