YOU NEVER KNOW HOW STRONG YOU ARE UNTIL BEING STRONG IS THE ONLY CHOICE YOU HAVE IN LIFE.
ENJOY LIFE TODAY, YESTERDAY IS GONE AND TOMORROW MAY NEVER CAME UP.
SOME PEOPLE ARE SO POOR, ALL THEY HAVE IS MONEY.
LIFE IS A ONE TIME OFFER, USE IT WELL.
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT FINDING YOURSELF. LIFE IS ABOUT CREATING YOURSELF.
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR.
FORGET THE DAY’S TROUBLES. REMEMBER THE DAYS BLESSINGS.
LIFE DOESN’T GET EASIER, YOU JUST GET STRONGER.
LOVE THE LIFE YOU LIVE, LIVE THE LIFE YOU LOVE.
NEVER GET SO BUSY MAKING A LIVING THAT YOU FORGET TO MAKE A LIFE.
DREAM AS IF YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER. LIVE AS IF YOU WILL DIE TODAY.
